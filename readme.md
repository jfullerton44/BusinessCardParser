The project include is a business card parser that takes a single input as a command line parameter. The input must be the name of a text file that contains the information from the business card. An example input is included called test.txt.

Due to how the algorithm works the program will not work for finding names if the users name is not included in their email address.
In addition, if the part of the name that is included in the email addresss is shorter than 3 characters the name will not be found correctly.

The entire program can be compilied with make which will create an output file called ReadText.

When the progarm is run it will output the Contact information thorough standard cout.
